# ReplayMod
A Minecraft mod to record game sessions and replay them afterwards from any perspective.

## Building
Make sure your sub-projects are up-to-date: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

For compiling 1.7.10, you must run `./gradlew :jGui:1.7.10:setupDecompWorkspace :1.7.10:setupDecompWorkspace` once after the initial clone. This may take quite some time.

### No IDE
You can build the mod by running `./gradlew build` (or just `./gradlew bundleJar`). You can then find the final jar files in `versions/$MCVERSION/build/libs/`.
You can also build single versions by running `./gradlew :1.8:build` (or just `./gradlew :1.8:bundleJar`) (builds the MC 1.8 version).

### IntelliJ
Ensure you have at least IDEA 2020.1.
Build the mod via Gradle as explained above at least once (`./gradlew compileJava` should be sufficient). This will ensure that the sources for all MC versions are generated.
Then import the Gradle project from within IDEA: File -> Open -> build.gradle -> Open as Project
Finally configure IDEA to build everything by itself instead of delegating it to Gradle (cause that is slow): File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Build and run using: IntelliJ IDEA

## Development
### Branches
Loosely based on [this branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) with `stable` instead of `master`.

TL;DR:
Main development happens on the `develop` branch, snapshots are built from this branch.
The `stable` branch contains the most recent release.

The `master` branch is solely to be used for the `version.json` file that contains a list of all versions
used by the clients to check for updates of this mod.

### The Preprocessor
To support multiple Minecraft versions with the ReplayMod, a [JCP](https://github.com/raydac/java-comment-preprocessor)-inspired preprocessor is used.
It has by now acquired a lot more sophisticated features to make it as noninvasive as possible.
Please read the [preprocessor's README](https://github.com/ReplayMod/preprocessor/blob/master/README.md) to understand how it works.

### Versioning
The ReplayMod uses the versioning scheme outlined [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20161103080129/http://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/)
with three changes:
- No `MAJORAPI`, the ReplayMod does not provide any external API
- "Updating to a new Minecraft version" should not increment `MAJORMOD`, we maintain one version of the ReplayMod
for each version of Minecraft and all these versions share the same feature set (and most bugs). We therefore try to
keep the version name the same for all of them (with the exception of `MCVERSION` of course). This also means that the
"Multiple Minecraft Version" section does not apply.
- For pre-releases the shorter `-bX` is used instead of `-betaX`

When a new version is (pre-)release, a new commit modifying the `version.txt` file should be added and the
`versions.json` file in the `master` branch should be updated. To simplify this process the gradle task `doRelease` can
be used: `./gradlew -PreleaseVersion=2.0.0-rc1 doRelease`. It will create the commit and update the version.json
accordingly.

Care should be taken that the updated `version.json` is not pushed before a jar file is available on the
download page (or Jenkins) as it will inform the users of the update.

### Bugs
GitHub should generally be used to report bugs.

In the past, bugs were tracked via [Bugzilla](https://bugs.replaymod.com/), so bug numbers in commits prior to 2020 such as `(fixes #42)` generally referred to Bugzilla unless noted otherwise.
